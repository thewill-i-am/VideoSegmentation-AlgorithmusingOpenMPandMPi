# VideoSegmentation-AlgorithmusingOpenMPandMPi

This repository contains an efficient parallel algorithm for segmenting video into disjoint sets of homogeneous frames based on defined criteria. The algorithm combines two programming paradigms - shared memory with OpenMP and distributed memory with MPI - to achieve high performance on parallel architectures. The implementation includes two levels of parallelism and is designed to work with large video datasets. The code is written in C/C++ and includes examples demonstrating its use.
